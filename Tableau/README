## Notes 

# Tableau Prep
Tableau Prep allows user to clean/transform the dirty data and perform necessary joins with other datasets.
Once the transformation is complete, we can output the results into a file and store it in local. Alternatively, it can also be stored in Tableau server. 

# Tableau Desktop
Tableau Desktop could perform some ETLs and perform the necessary visualizations after the ETL is complete.
